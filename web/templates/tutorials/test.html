<h1>How to Use AppArmor to Secure Applications in Debian</h1>

<h2>Sudo apt-get install AppArmor</h2>
<p>In this tutorial, we will learn how to use AppArmor to secure applications in Debian. The first step is to install
    AppArmor using the <code>sudo apt-get install apparmor</code> command. This command will install AppArmor on your
    system and enable it. After the installation is complete, you can use the <code>sudo systemctl enable
        apparmor</code> command to enable AppArmor. Once AppArmor is enabled, you can use the <code>sudo aa-genprof &lt;application_name&gt;</code>
    command to generate a profile for the application. Finally, you can use the <code>sudo aa-complain &lt;application&gt;</code>
    command to enable AppArmor for the application. By following these steps, you can easily secure your applications in
    Debian using AppArmor.</p>

<h2>sudo systemctl enable apparmor</h2>

    service. After running this command, you can use AppArmor to secure applications in Debian. To install AppArmor, you
    need to run the command <code>sudo apt-get install apparmor</code>. After installation, you can use the command
    <code>sudo aa-genprof &lt;application_name&gt;</code> to generate a profile for the application. To enable the
